## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Major league baseball game data is available from an organization called Retrosheet.org.  The data is provided via downloadable delimited text files which can be painstakenly deciphered with documentation.

To be useful this data needs to be organized and loaded into a database where it can be analyzed and queried.




### Features
My project will load just small set of this data for major league seasons 1982 and 2015 to a database

My project wil then provide a simple UI that allows a user to query 
- for a specific game and view information for the players of that game
- for a specific player and view information for the games for that player

Data for the regular season, wild card, division championship, league championship, and world series games will be loaded for the 1982 and 2015 major league seasons.

If time allows my project will also require the user to log in so that user information such as email address can be collected.
